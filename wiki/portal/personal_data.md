## Regarding the processing of sensitive data
By the term ‘sensitive data’, we mean special categories of personal data 
as defined in Article 9 (1) GDPR: 

Processing of sensitive data is “processing of personal data revealing racial 
or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or 
trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for 
the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health 
or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation”. 

“The processing of photographs should not systematically be considered to be 
processing of special categories of personal data as they are covered by the 
definition of biometric data only when processed through a specific technical 
means allowing the unique identification or authentication of a natural person.”
(see Recital 51 GDPR)

### Article 4 (1) GDPR 
“‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable 
natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can 
be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier 
such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or 
to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, 
economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”

### Article 4 (2) GDPR
“‘processing’ means any operation or set of operations which is performed on 
personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, 
such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation 
or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, 
dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, 
restriction, erasure or destruction”

### Article 4 (13) GDPR
“‘genetic data’ means personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic 
characteristics of a natural person which give unique information about the 
physiology or the health of that natural person and which result, in particular, 
from an analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question;”

### Article 4 (14) GDPR
“‘biometric data’ means personal data resulting from specific technical processing 
relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural 
person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that natural person, 
such as facial images or dactyloscopic data;”

### Article 4 (15) GDPR
“‘data concerning health’ means personal data related to the physical or mental 
health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, 
which reveal information about his or her health status;”

### Article 9 (1) GDPR
“Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, 
religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing 
of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural 
person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or 
sexual orientation shall be prohibited.”

### Recital 10 GDPR
“In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natural persons 
and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal data within the Union, the 
level of protection of the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard 
to the processing of such data should be equivalent in all Member States. 
Consistent and homogenous application of the rules for the protection of the 
fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing 
of personal data should be ensured throughout the Union. 
Regarding the processing of personal data for compliance with a legal obligation, 
for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the 
exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Member States should 
be allowed to maintain or introduce national provisions to further specify the 
application of the rules of this Regulation. In conjunction with the general 
and horizontal law on data protection implementing Directive 95/46/EC, Member 
States have several sector-specific laws in areas that need more specific provisions. 
This Regulation also provides a margin of manoeuvre for Member States to specify 
its rules, including for the processing of special categories of personal data 
(‘sensitive data’). To that extent, this Regulation does not exclude Member State 
law that sets out the circumstances for specific processing situations, including 
determining more precisely the conditions under which the processing of personal 
data is lawful.”

### Recital 51 GDPR
“Personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation 
to fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of 
their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and 
freedoms. Those personal data should include personal data revealing racial or 
ethnic origin, whereby the use of the term ‘racial origin’ in this Regulation 
does not imply an acceptance by the Union of theories which attempt to determine 
the existence of separate human races. The processing of photographs should not 
systematically be considered to be processing of special categories of personal 
data as they are covered by the definition of biometric data only when processed 
through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or 
authentication of a natural person. Such personal data should not be processed, 
unless processing is allowed in specific cases set out in this Regulation, 
taking into account that Member States law may lay down specific provisions 
on data protection in order to adapt the application of the rules of this 
Regulation for compliance with a legal obligation or for the performance of 
a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official 
authority vested in the controller. In addition to the specific requirements 
for such processing, the general principles and other rules of this Regulation 
should apply, in particular as regards the conditions for lawful processing. 
Derogations from the general prohibition for processing such special categories 
of personal data should be explicitly provided, inter alia, where the data 
subject gives his or her explicit consent or in respect of specific needs in 
particular where the processing is carried out in the course of legitimate 
activities by certain associations or foundations the purpose of which is to 
permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms.”
