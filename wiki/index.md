Welcome to the SimpleVM Wiki!
Below you will find a brief overview of the most important functions of SimpleVM.


# SimpleVM

Start and manage virtual machines with ease and let SimpleVM take care of various settings for you.

`Easy setup`
:    SimpleVM runs in a pre-configured network setup. You don't have to set up anything, start your VM with just some 
clicks. Afterward, you only need to install the tools you need to work on your project.
Even then, SimpleVM might already offer to do it for you.
See [Create Instance](simple_vm/create_instance.md) for more details.

`SSH access`
:    SimpleVM configures the SSH access for you and provides you with all appropriate commands for SSH access.
See [Keypairs](simple_vm/keypairs.md) for more details.

`Browser-based access`
:    SimpleVM can configure browser-based access to your VM based on your chosen research environment, like
RStudio, Apache Guacamole or VSCode.<br>
It further provides you with a custom URL. 
See [Research environments](simple_vm/customization.md#research-environments) for more details.

`Tools and environment setup`
:    SimpleVM can set up a Conda environment and install tools of your choosing from various Conda channels.
See [Conda](simple_vm/customization.md#conda) for more details.

`Volume management`
:    Manage your volumes with SimpleVM. Create, attach and mount them to your virtual machines.
See [Volumes](simple_vm/volumes.md) for more details.

`Snapshot management`
:    Manage vm snapshots with SimpleVM. Create a snapshot of a virtual machine and
start new virtual machines with that snapshot, saving time by not having to configure machines with the same settings.
See [Images and Snapshots](simple_vm/snapshots.md) for more details.

`Cluster management`
:    Manage clusters with SimpleVM. Create a cluster, remove, and add nodes.
See [Cluster](simple_vm/Cluster/index.md) for more details.

`Machine management`
:    Manage your virtual machines with SimpleVM. You can stop, reboot, manage volume attachments, 
and delete your vms on one page.
See [Instance overview](simple_vm/instance_overview.md) for more details.

`Workshop management`
:    Manage your workshops with SimpleVM. You can create workshops, 
add users and administrators, start virtual machines for all users, and email them information about
their personal virtual machine.
See [Workshop](simple_vm/workshop.md) for more details.
