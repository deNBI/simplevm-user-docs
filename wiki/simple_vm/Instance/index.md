# Instances

SimpleVM allows machines to be started quickly, easily and without extensive background knowledge of cloud computing.

## Start and manage your machines

Virtual machines are started using a specially developed form.
A detailed explanation of all steps and selection options can be found under [Create Instance](./create_instance.md).

The management of your machines is possible in the [Instance Overview](./instance_overview.md), which displays all your machines, which you are allowed to handle.
The [Instance Detail](./instance_detail.md) page of each machine holds more detailed information and additional configuration and management options.

## Clusters

In SimpleVM, you use clusters similarly to your usual virtual machines.
Take a look at the [Cluster](../Cluster/index.md)-page for more information on this feature.
