# Project Management

The resources available for use, group memberships and permissions are organized with projects within SimpleVM. The single projects one is a member in can be seen in the sidebar. In case if you have a high number of project memberships, it might be, that the single projects are hidden in the menu-dropdown "Your Projects".
Regarding group and project permissions please have a look [here](./permissions.md).

## Project Overview

When clicking on a certain project, the project overview gets shown.
![user_management](./img/project_management/project_overview.png)
It shows an overview of the resources available for the project and holds links to the most important features as starting of machines and creating volumes specifically for the project shown.
Under "Open Registration" project administators are able to create an invitation link, that can be used to add more users to the project.

## Instances

When clicking on instances, the tab which holds an overview similar to the [general instance overview](./Instance/instance_overview.md) will be shown.
It lists all machines one is allowed to see and which are part of the corresponding project.
